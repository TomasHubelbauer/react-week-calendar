# React Week Calendar

This repository is a stub for an idea which I want to work on or abandon.

The idea is to build a React component for a week calendar, which avoids the use of wonky techniques such as accessing the DOM nodes
directly, doing calculations with their coordinates in the DOM, setting dynamic values for absolutely positioned elements or hooking
into scroll handlers. I dislike all this stuff and try to rip it out whenever I see it, so that's what I'll try to avoid here.

Another point is to avoid using a big number of DOM nodes. There are existing calendar components, none of which I really like,
and this is my attempt to do better or learn why it is not possible for me to do better than what's available.
